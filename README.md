# Action-Recognition-using-UCF50

I've had an incredibly enriching experience at Corvit Institute in Peshawar! My journey from basic to advanced topics and then moved to machine learning and deep learning, as well as my exposure to various algorithms and frameworks, demonstrates a comprehensive and well-rounded education.

Starting with foundational concepts such as data analysis and progressing through image classification using machine learning algorithms, and then delving into deep learning with frameworks like Keras and PyTorch, shows my strong dedication to mastering the field.

# Moreover, 
my exploration of object detection, image segmentation using YOLO variants, and now diving into generative AI highlights a diverse skill set and a willingness to explore cutting-edge technologies.
It's evident that my teacher, Sir Kaleem Ullah, has played a significant role in shaping my learning journey with his dedication and expertise. Having an intellectual mentor who teaches from the heart can make all the difference in grasping complex concepts and pushing boundaries in my understanding.

# Sum Up!
Overall, my experience at Corvit Institute seems not only educational but also inspiring. I'll keep up the fantastic work and continue to explore and innovate in the exciting field of artificial intelligence!
InshaALLAH❤
AlhamduLILLAH!❤

specifically , do the same as I did in the previous repositories.
Run the following ".ipynb code", then download the "new.h5 file" , save in the ActionRecognition Folder.
Thank You.
